# rust-todo-cli
## What is this?
This is a simple todo console app with ui for Linux, MacOs and Windows. It is my first Rust project, and i was having a blast making it. It isn't rocket science - you can create tasks, rename them and change their completion status. For gui, i used ratatui starting template, and for database - local sqlite database.
